BUGS--
To Do [still need to handle the save data, if presented with edge cases]
To Do [Require To Investigate if implementation the save functonality is appropiate in the router or not]
To Do [when sending data through the client when deleting multiple presses of buttons is required sometimes to make it work]
To Do change the assignment of id is done, the current array.length causes duplications when deleting an element
To Do accessing elements in array starting at index 0 and assigning id at index 1 causes confusion and it creates bugs and errors.

WINS AND CHALLENGES
I tried to call the reading and writing file from another js file but it register errors and complaines about variables not initilaised or not present
More Confidence in using Json and manipulete the data within it.
